							Among the first to see the court magistrate for his refusal to register with the government in South Africa, Gandhi is arrested and spends all of his time in prison reading.

						Gandhi is approached by Nathuram Vinayuk Godse, a Hindu nationalist. Gandhi blesses him and the man then shoots and kills him for being too sympathetic to the Muslims. Godse is wrong in his belief that killing Gandhi will lead to war that will eliminate Muslims. Instead, mourning over Gandhi's death leads to peace.
