							<p> His friend Daniele da Volterra watches him work all day February 12 on the RONDANINI PIETÀ. Two days later he comes down with a fever but goes for a walk in the cold night air, saying he just can’t rest.  The next day he spends sitting next to the fireplace but finally must crawl into bed.  He dies on February 18.  The Pope wants to have him buried in St. Peter’s but Michelangelo’s nephew and heir, Leonardo, takes the body back to Florence, where it is buried in Santa Croce.  More than a hundred artists attend his funeral.
